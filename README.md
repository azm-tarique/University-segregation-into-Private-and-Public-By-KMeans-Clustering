# University-segregation-into-Private-and-Public-By-KMeans-Clustering
For this project we will attempt to use KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.

The Contributions
1.  Import pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn
2.  Exploratory data analysis(EDA) Create a scatterplot of Grad.Rate versus Room.Board where the points are colored by the    Private column.
3.  Create a stacked histogram showing Out of State Tuition based on the Private column
4.  Create an instance of a K Means model with 2 clusters.
5.  Fit the model to all the data except for the Private label
6.  Evaluate: Create a confusion matrix and classification report to see how well the Kmeans clustering work.
