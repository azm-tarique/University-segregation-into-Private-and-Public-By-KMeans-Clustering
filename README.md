# University-segregation-into-Private-and-Public-By-KMeans-Clustering
For this project we will attempt to use KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.

The Contributions
1.  Perform Exploratory data analysis(EDA) using scatterplot.
2.  Created stacked histogram visualization.
3.  Created a KMeans cluster model for clustering
4.  Generate confusion Matrix and classifications report for the KMeans clustering model
